                    We treat the Information we receive as confidential, and
                    only use it and share it as expressly permitted under this
                    Privacy Policy. We take commercially reasonable steps to
                    protect the Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized
                    access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We maintain
                    physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply
                    with applicable state and federal laws and regulations to
                    guard non-public personal financial information from
                    unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. Please understand,
                    however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot
                    guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we
